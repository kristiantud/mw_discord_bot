# mw_discord_bot
Discord bot that fetches the last nth games for the user. 

Used Node.js, Discord.js, and call-of-duty-api.

The user can tell the bot what their gamertag is, and call the command !recent n (where n is any number), and the bot will fetch that lobby's stats.

This bot lists the user's team's stats, while also looking at the best performers in the lobby. The bot also looks at potential popular players and tells the user when a streamer/professional player is found in the same lobby.
